# Python Modules and Packages
A Python package is nothing but a collection of modules along with a __init__.py file. The modules can also be arranged in hierarchy of folders inside a package. Just by adding an empty __init__.py file to the in the folder, Python knows it is a Package.

## Importing 
From ______ import ______
E.g. from cryptography import Fernet
So, like this we can import.

## Creating a Package
Basically, a package itself is a folder, to create one simply,
1.	 Create a new folder
2.	 Give it a name
3.	Inside the folder, first add an init file which tells python that it is a package. To do this create a new file in the package as __init__.
4.	Add different class files in the package.
5.	According all your needs, you can create modules of your functionality and create files in the package. E.g. calculation, etc.
So, by making packages and modules we can code effectively without making our program messy.
